# cs344_adventure
Small game in C using Unix programming techniques.

* Compile both files, then run `buildrooms` to create a list of room files through which the user can move
* Running `adventure` will allow the user to move through the rooms until the "end" is found. `adventure` reads
from the randomly created room files
* The `time` command will output the current system time and write it to `currentTime.txt`
